## How to use NCSDownloader
Download this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/tif24048/NCSDownloader.git
```
Make the script executable
```
chmod +x ncs
```
Next execute the script and type the name of a NCS song, for example Invicible
```
./ncs invincible
```
Because so many NCS songs have duplicate names you might not be able to download certain songs through this script.
